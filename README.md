# flags
Project Goal
> The goal of my project is to develop a CNN model that can identify the “Country Name” looking at the picture of the flag. 
> I have collected 1000 images of flags of various countries. 
> I have split the data into – 800 pictures for training, 100 for validation and 100 for training.
> All the images of flags have been cropped to 256 X 256 dimensions. 
> A single layer CNN model is build (with 64 filters) with a Python Notebook file (.ipynb)
